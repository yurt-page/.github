# Yurt Page: your own homepage website for free and for freedom
Yurt is a small house that is easy to construct.

The YurtPage is a small homepage that all people can deploy on their own devices like router, Raspberry Pi, PC or even TV.
So you don't need to pay for hosting.
The main goal is to make a self hosted website as cheap as possible and typical usage is to have a closed family storage of photos or an even small blog.
I.e. something that is not interesting for spammers and with a small amount of visitors and load.

If you have friends with a YurtPage then your data will be encrypted and stored on their devices and this gives you a backup for free.
This architecture improves privacy but also makes the internet more distributed and stable.

See [Design documentation](https://github.com/yurt-page/docs/blob/main/README.md) for details.
